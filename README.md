# Project README.md
Evaluating insertion sort performance across different systems in two different languages: python and C++.

We are presenting as the first group on April 22rd.

## Quick Note
Hey guys I want to make a CSV out of the results.txt and do a quick data minding algorthim on it to find out the influence of each attribute. Will you include your operating system's version in results.txt?


## How to Run These Programs

### C++
> `g++ insertionSort.cpp -o output`
> `./output`

### Python
> `python insertionSort.py`
