# Project README.md
Evaluating bubble sort performance across different systems in two different languages: python and C++.

We plan to present on April 23rd.


## Our Systems
- Quetzin's Mac, M1, 16GB
- Quetzin's Mac, Intel i7, 16GB
- Quetzin's Windows, Intel i7, 32GB
- Quetzin's Windows, Intel i9, 32GB
- Tanner's Windows, Intel i7 4790k with 4 cores @ 4.0 Ghz, 16GB
- Tanner's Windows, AMD Ryzen 7 5800H with 8 cores @ 3201 Mhz, 16 GB


## How to Run These Programs

### C++
> `g++ bubbleSort.cpp -o output`
> `./output`
- I think these gcc commands are only for compiling on linux (TXST's zeus/eros servers). We really should compile and run them on our own computers for performance evaluation. - Tanner

### Python
> `python bubbleSort.py`


## Random Notes
- I was able to give Suman and Youssef collaborator permissions on the repo since they have their TXST email linked with GitHub. @Farrah and @Quetzin, what email do y'all use for GitHub, so I can add yall too? - Tanner
